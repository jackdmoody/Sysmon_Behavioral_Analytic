## Stochastic Graph-Based Behavioral Drift Detection for Endpoint Telemetry in Operational Cyber Environments

Modern cyber defense operations generate massive volumes of endpoint telemetry, yet most detection systems rely on static rules or single-model anomaly scoring that fail to capture higher-order behavioral dynamics. This work presents a unified stochastic–structural framework for host-level behavioral anomaly detection using Windows Sysmon telemetry. The proposed analytic models each endpoint as a stochastic graph process, combining directed event-pair graphs with host-specific Markov transition matrices to characterize temporal and structural behavior simultaneously.

Behavioral deviation is quantified using information-theoretic divergence, specifically Jensen–Shannon divergence between host transition distributions and peer baselines. This approach enables principled measurement of behavioral drift rather than reliance on isolated outlier detection. The framework further integrates graph structural metrics, Isolation Forest anomaly scoring, and MITRE ATT&CK semantic enrichment into a multi-view ensemble evidence fusion model designed for Security Operations Center (SOC) triage.

Unlike deep neural approaches requiring extensive labeled datasets, this method emphasizes interpretability, statistical grounding, and operational alignment. Transition matrices, divergence metrics, and graph features remain auditable and explainable—critical properties for high-stakes cyber decision environments within Department of Defense contexts.

The contribution is not a new standalone algorithm, but the structured integration of stochastic modeling, graph topology analysis, information-theoretic drift detection, and semantic adversary mapping into a cohesive host-level behavioral analytic pipeline. This integrated approach addresses a gap between theoretical anomaly detection research and operational cyber defense decision-support systems.

The proposed framework provides a scalable and interpretable foundation for advanced analytics in cyber mission forces, enabling improved prioritization of anomalous hosts, earlier identification of adversary tradecraft, and enhanced decision support for commanders operating in contested information environments.
